# UPDATER
DEBIAN-UBUNTU-MINT UPDATER.
This is a bash script updater that updates repos, upgrades the system, removes any orphaned dependencies, clears the apt cache, and lists and packages that need upgraded. WARNING: The apt autoremove and apt autoclean commands run automatically by default.
You also have to make the script executable for your system. By default, the permissions are set to read/write only. This can be done with the command: sudo chmod +X up.
Place the script in either $HOME/bin or /usr/bin directories.
